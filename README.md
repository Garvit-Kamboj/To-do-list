# To-do-list
This is a To-do list in just 50 lines of JavaScript code in which users can add, delete a task and mark it as completed by clicking on nice little icons imported from Font Awesome gallery. This is great for people who want to manage their tasks on a daily basis and want a clean interface. Go check it out, folks!
